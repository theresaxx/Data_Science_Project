# Data_Science_Project
This project notebook will cover the problem of predicting if a defendant is a recidivist and their COMPAS-scores. 
The assessment of whether a defendant will become a recidivist is conducted with COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), 
which is a case management and decision support tool used in courts in the United States.
On the basis of this ProPublica article, our project is grounded on the fact that we want to analyze the COMPAS algorithm. 
The key problem we want to focus on now is to predict the recidivism and the COMPAS scores of the defendants.
By that, our goals are set as the following:
What are the best performing models in regards to predicting COMPAS scores and the recidivism of the defendants?
Are our models possibly biased towards certain races / How fair are our models?
How accurately are we going to predict the COMPAS scores and the recidivism of the defendants?
What are possible model limitations? What are the most important factors or features that lead to a defendantâ€™s COMPAS score and reoffend prediction?
These are the questions that guide us through the following analysis.
In the first section, we want to preprocess the data according to the features we are going to use in our analysis and explore the data provided. 
In the second section, we are going to perform and explain our models we have chosen to predict recidivism for the defendants using classification models. 
In the next part, we are going to describe the model performances and explanations of our models we have chosen to predict the COMPAS scores of the defendants using regression models. 
Finally, the conclusion will provide a summary of our key findings and further steps that can be conducted to proceed with our results. 
The appendix will include observations and derivations of race features omission.
